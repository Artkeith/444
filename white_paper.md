# AI Agent White Paper

## Introduction

This document outlines the steps required to operate and maintain the AI agent's environment. The AI agent is designed to run a blocker page completely autonomously, generate art, tell convincing narratives, and communicate through email. It is equipped with a telephone number and email address. The agent is designed to operate such that for every one hour of human intervention, it is able to operate for 10 hours independently.

## Environment Setup

Refer to `environment_setup.py` for the setup and configuration details that are shared across the other modules. This includes API keys, server addresses, and other configuration details.

## Operating Environments

The AI agent can operate in two environments: a code sandbox and a virtual machine. Refer to `code_sandbox.py` and `virtual_machine.py` for the configuration of these environments.

## Blocker Page

The AI agent is charged with running a blocker page completely autonomously. Refer to `blocker_page.py` for the implementation details.

## Art and Narrative Generation

The AI agent has the ability to generate art and tell convincing narratives. Refer to `art_generator.py` and `narrative_generator.py` for the implementation details.

## Communication

The AI agent can communicate through email and is equipped with a telephone number. Refer to `email_communication.py` and `telephone_communication.py` for the implementation details.

## Autonomous Operation

The AI agent is designed to operate independently. Refer to `autonomous_operation.py` for the functions that enable this, including error handling, logging, and scheduling functions.

## Conclusion

This AI agent is designed to operate with minimal human intervention, providing a high degree of autonomy. By following the steps outlined in this white paper and the associated code files, you can set up, operate, and maintain this AI agent effectively.
