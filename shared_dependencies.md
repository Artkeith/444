Shared Dependencies:

1. "ai_agent" - This is the main module that all the other files are part of. It's the main namespace for the project.

2. "environment_setup" - This module is likely to contain setup and configuration details that are shared across the other modules. It might include things like API keys, server addresses, and other configuration details.

3. "communication_details" - This could be a data schema that includes fields for the AI agent's telephone number and email address. It would be used in the email_communication and telephone_communication modules.

4. "autonomous_operation" - This module might contain functions that are used across multiple other modules to enable the AI agent to operate independently. It could include things like error handling, logging, and scheduling functions.

5. "blocker_page" - This could be an ID for a DOM element that is manipulated by the blocker_page module. It might also be used by the autonomous_operation module to check the status of the blocker page.

6. "art_generator" and "narrative_generator" - These could be function names that are used in multiple modules. They might be used in the autonomous_operation module to generate art and narratives as part of the AI agent's independent operation.

7. "email_communication" and "telephone_communication" - These could be message names that are used in the communication modules. They might also be used in the autonomous_operation module to send communications as part of the AI agent's independent operation.

8. "virtual_machine" and "code_sandbox" - These could be names of environments that the AI agent can operate in. They might be used in the environment_setup module to configure the AI agent's operating environment.
